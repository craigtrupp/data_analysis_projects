IBM has a comprehensive learning path available through Coursera with a culminating capstone project which will be linked to below. Throughout the program, the curriculum offers labs, tests, exercises and ultimately the capstone project to bring together skills and tools that represent the most up-to-date practical skills and tools that data analysts use in their daily roles. Such ares of focus included
* Spreadsheets, Microsoft Excel
* Python Programming, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
* SQL, Dashboard and BI Tools such as IBM Cognos Analytics
* Presentation Generation for Business Metrics and Stakeholder Presentation

#### `DataCamp`
![Dcamp](images/dcamp_preview.png)
DataCamp offers various levels of certification for users of the platform to have their technical and reporting accumen put to the test to prove your skills are job-ready with **Associate** and **Professional** level certifications.  DataCamp's coding challenges are free form, where candidates are presented with certain data but it is up to them to come up with an appropriate solution. The goal of this task is to demonstrate that the individual has the ability to perform the tasks required of them as a data analyst or scientist without being guided towards the appropriate solution.
