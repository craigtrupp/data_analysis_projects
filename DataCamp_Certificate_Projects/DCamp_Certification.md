# 📜 **DataCamp Certification Projects** 📜
Following completion of learning tracks on the platform (or available to learners with previous programming/data experience), different levels of certification are presented to users to apply learned data skills on a sample business problem. To date, I've completed the platform's two professional level certifications, **Data Analyst Professional** and **Data Scientist Professional**. Please see further details below about the process including 
* Timed Assessment ⏲️
* Practical Exam :paperclips:
* Presentation 🖼️
    * Along with the presentation material, the final step of each professional certificate is creating a recording with your presentation materials as supporting visual evidence on your finding and recommendation for the business

##  **Certification Overview Process**
DataCamp Certification is an official recognition that you've achieved the required skill level as either a Data Scientist :scientist: <br> or Data Analyst :technologist:. We measure your abilities through timed exams and a practical exam based on scenarios you're likely to find in the workplace. Our Certifications have been developed with the help of data experts representing a variety of industries, organizations, and roles.

## **`Certification Flow`**
### **Timed Exams** ⏲️
The following exams for each professional certificate were passed prior to advancing to the practical exam submission. Prefixed `DA` exams were for **Data Analyst Professional** and `DS` exams were for **Data Scientist Professional**. Each assessment was completed with **Python** when presented with an option with either **R** or **Python**.

* `DA101` is a 45-minute exam that assesses your proficiency in **data management**, **exploratory analysis**, and **statistical experimentation using SQL.** This exam consisted of the following topics
    * Perform data extraction, joining and aggregation tasks
    * Perform cleaning tasks to prepare data for analysis
    * Assess data quality and perform validation tasks
    * Calculate metrics to effectively report characteristics of data and relationships between features
    * Read, and analyze data visualizations to represent the relationships between features
    * Describe statistical concepts that underpin hypothesis testing and experimentation

<br>

* `DA201` is a 60-minute that assesses your abilities to use R or Python for **data management**, exploratory analysis, and statistical experimentation. To successfully pass this exam, you will need to
    * Perform standard data extraction, joining and aggregation tasks
    * Create data visualizations in Python or R to demonstrate the characteristics of data
    * Create data visualizations in Python or R to represent the relationships between features
    * Describe statistical concepts that underpin hypothesis testing and experimentation (i.e., statistical distributions, power analysis, parameter estimation and confidence intervals)

<br>

* `DS101` is a 45-minute exam where you'll choose either R or Python to work through the questions. This exam assesses your abilities to use R or Python for exploratory analysis and statistical experimentation. To successfully pass this exam, you will need to
    * Calculate metrics to effectively report characteristics of data and relationships between features
    * Create data visualizations in Python or R to demonstrate the characteristics of data
    * Create data visualizations in Python or R to represent the relationships between features
    * Describe statistical concepts that underpin hypothesis testing and experimentation (i.e., statistical distributions, power analysis, parameter estimation and confidence intervals)
    * Apply sampling methods to data
    * Implement methods for performing statistical tests

<br>

* `DS201` is a 60-minute exam that assesses your data management, programming, and modeling skills in R or Python, and data management skills using SQL. To successfully pass this exam, you will need to 
    * Perform data extraction, joining and aggregation tasks in SQL
    * Perform cleaning tasks to prepare data for analysis in SQL
    * Assess data quality and perform validation tasks in SQL
    * Perform standard data import, joining, and aggregation tasks using R or Python
    * Perform standard cleaning tasks to prepare data for analysis using R or Python
    * Assess data quality and perform validation tasks using R or Python
    * Collect data from non-standard formats using R or Python
    * Prepare data for modeling by implementing relevant transformations Implement standard modeling approaches for supervised learning problems
    * Use suitable methods to assess the performance of a model
    * Implement approaches for unsupervised learning problems
    * Use common programming constructs to write repeatable production quality code for analysis (i.e., functions, control flow, loops and iterations)
    * Demonstrate best practices in production code including version control, testing and package development (i.e., version control, package building)

<br>

### **Practical Exam** 📝
The final step in this certification is a practical exam. The practical exam assesses your skills in data visualization and communication. You'll review a business problem, select and create appropriate visualizations, and give a relevant summary of what you have found to the defined audience. You'll need to record your presentation and submit it via the certification portal. 

To pass the practical exam, you'll need to
* Present data concepts to small, diverse audiences
* Effectively employ data visualization to support my findings
* Frame, convey, and summarize stories using data
* Employ multiple tactics (written and verbal) to communicate to business leaders
